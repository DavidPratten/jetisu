    "The next question to ask is computed 'on-the-fly' by jetisu. Of the columns containing unknown values, the best column to ask a question about is found by using the following scoring system:\n",
    "- The more values in a column, the higher the column's score. e.g. The ```work_sector``` column has 7 values so will be higher scored that a True/False column like ```private_home_only```\n",
    "- If the column is a cross-product of the other columns the score is lower. (Still working on a compelling illustration of this heuristic.)\n",
    "- The more equal the distribution of values in the column the higher the score. e.g. if a column has three values, but 90% of the rows have just one value and the remaining two values share 10% of the rows, then this will score lower than a column of three values where the distribution is more equal.\n",
