# About the Logo
"Jetisu" (Kazakh Жетісу) is [a region in south-east Kazakhstan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhetysu).  

"Jetisu" means seven rivers and refers to the rivers flowing into Lake Balkhash including the Ili River. 

"Jetisu" is a metaphore for the multiple streams of work that the toolset draws on. These streams include:
- Logic
- Logic programming languages
- Solvers
- Relational Model
- Query Languages
- etc.

The logo reinterprets this idea and captures seven features of the Ili river valley landscape:
- sky,
- snowy peaks,
- slopes,
- summer grasslands, 
- desert, 
- canyons and
- rivers.
